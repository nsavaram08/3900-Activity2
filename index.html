            Hello everyone, this is Naga Nishanti Savaram, I'm pursuing my masters in MIS (Management Information Systems) at UNO since fall 2023.
            I completed my undergraduate degree in electronics and communication engineering in 2017.
            I was working as a senior support engineer from Hewlett Packard since 2017.
            I started my career as a technical support engineer. After that I got promoted as senior engineer
            where we deal with clients on network issues and resolve within required SLA(i.e service line agreement).
            I quit my job on july 24th since I was married to an UNO alumni and also to pursue my masters here.

            My hobbies are watching TV, cooking and travelling. I watch a lot of recipe videos from the
            different countries and am always interested in cooking some. My favorite dish is a south-indian rice dish called Biryani.
            The image below was taken when I tried cooking for the first time during my under-graduation

            I visited maldives this summer after getting married. It was my first international trip.
            I really enjoyed the views, the islands, the weather and the beaches.
            I also tried some authentic maldivian food along with other cuisines.

            I am currently exploring Omaha, some restaurants, some parks like gene leahy mall and the zoo.
            Would love any suggestions to travel or any food, especially deserts.
