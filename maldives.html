<h2> Experience in maldives</h2>

<p>

    The main city of maldives is male.
    From there, we took a speedboat to reach our resort.
    First we were welcomed by coconut water and then the hotel staff gave us the resort tour.
    We stayed there for 3 days. On the very first day, we saw a beautiful sunset and I clicked a few pictures.
    The second day, we went to watch dolphins in the middle of the ocean.
