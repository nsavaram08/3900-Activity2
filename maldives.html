        The capital city of the Maldives is Mal√©.
        We landed in the Maldives on May19th .From there, we took a speedboat ride to reach our resort.
        We stayed in an over water villa for 3 days.
        First we were welcomed by coconut water and then the hotel staff gave us the resort tour and suggested activities to be explored in the resort.
        We were provided by snorkeling kits and could snorkel around our water villa.

        On the very first day, we saw a beautiful sunset and I clicked a few pictures.
        The second day, we went to watch dolphins in the middle of the ocean, which was an amazing experience.
        The last day on our trip we got to take a bike ride through the property and we could experience the Maldivian spa, Thai cuisine
        and the most important part I loved in the entire journey was I got to see the Nemo fish.
        I hope everyone should visit Maldives once in there lifetime as it is a out of the world experience.
